Child theming.

Create a Folder called 'themeName- child'.

Add style.css file and add this code (modified to suit your theme).

/*

*/
@import url("../twentythirteen/style.css");
/* =Theme customization starts here

Add the screenshot.

Go to Dashboard and activate the child theme...
ONLY after the dummy content has been uploaded to the parent.

Done!
