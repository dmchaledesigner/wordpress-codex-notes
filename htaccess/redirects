Transferring from old domain to new domain
=============================

If you had an old domain such as example.com, and now you decided you actually want to use example.net for the website.
You could setup a 301 redirect for the entire domain, so that old links to example.com carry over.


RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example.com [NC,OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.example.com [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.net/$1 [L,R=301,NC]



Force one type of domain to be used
=============================

A search engine like Google would see example.com and www.example.com as essentially two separate websites.
They recommend you pick one version you'd like search engines to display and using a 301 redirect is a possible option.

If you have a lot of links on the web where people are linking to your site as example.com,
but you would like your visitors to instead end up at www.example.com you can force this version of your domain with these rules:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example.com [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.example.com/$1 [L,R=301,NC]




Redirect individual files
=============================

To redirect individual files, like example.com/oldfile.htm to newfile.htm you can use a 301 redirect like this:

Redirect 301 /oldfile.htm /newfile.html





Redirect all links to the home page
=============================




RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/(index.html)?$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !.(gif|jpeg|png|css|js)$
RewriteRule .* / [L,R=302]
